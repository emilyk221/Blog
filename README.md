  ## Description
  This full-stack application is a blog site that allows users to share blog posts and comments about posts. This project follows the MVC paradigm, using Express.js to set up the server and API controllers, MySQL2 and Sequelize to set up the models connected to a MySQL database, and Handlebars for the views. Other packages used include express-session and connect-session-sequelize to add authentication, dotenv to use environment variables, and bcrypt to hash user passwords. Through API routes that follow CRUD principles, anyone can view blog posts and comments, while logged-in users can create new posts, edit or delete their posts, and post comments on the site. This is a great site for users to share their thoughts and opinions and converse with each other about technology. In the future, I hope to add features to this blog site including admin-level users, a separate forum-style interface, and a resources page.
